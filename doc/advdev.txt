                           ==========================
                           AdvanceMAME Device Drivers
                           ==========================

This file describes the video, sound, joystick, mouse
and keyboard drivers used by the Advance programs.


1 VIDEO DRIVERS
===============

1.1 Types of Drivers
--------------------

The video drivers can be divided in two different categories:

* Generate drivers able to program directly the video board.
* System drivers able to use only the available video modes.

---- 1.1.1 Generate drivers ----
This set of drivers is able to program directly the video board
to always generate a perfect video mode with the correct size
and frequency.

They always work in `fullscreen' output mode and generally
support only a subset of video boards.

To function correctly these drivers require a correct
configuration of the `device_video_*' options.

The `Generate' drivers are always the preferred choice.

---- 1.1.2 System drivers ----
This set of drivers is able to use only the video modes
available on the operating system.

They can work in `fullscreen' mode, `window' mode and `zoom'
output mode using the video board hardware acceleration to
stretch the image. The default output mode is `window' if you
run the program in a window manager, otherwise the output
mode `fullscreen' is chosen.

Please note that these drivers generally need to stretch the
image losing a lot in image quality and speed.

These drivers don't require any `device_video_*' options
because they cannot control how the video modes are generated.

1.2 Available Generate Drivers
------------------------------

The following is the list of all the video drivers supported.

---- 1.2.1 fb - Generate Frame Buffer video (Linux) ----
This driver works in Linux and is able to create video modes
using the Linux Kernel Frame Buffer interface.

All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.

This driver is able to use the Linux fb API to synchronize
with the vertical sync of the video mode, but generally
it isn't possible because the low-end drivers don't support
this feature. Anyway, if you run the program as root it can
use the standard VGA registers to detect the vsync.
This is the major limitation compared with the svgalib driver.

To allow any user to run the program as root, you can
use the following commands to change the executable
permissions:

    chown root:root /usr/local/bin/advmame
    chmod u+s /usr/local/bin/advmame

To use this driver you must activate the Console Frame Buffer
support in your Linux kernel.

This driver is not available in X (when the environment DISPLAY
variable is defined).

The Frame Buffer device opened is `/dev/fb0' and `/dev/fb/0', you
can change it setting the FRAMEBUFFER environment variable.

The generic Frame Buffer `vesafb' driver cannot be used because
it doesn't allow the creation of new video modes. If it's your
only option you can use it through the SDL library.

---- 1.2.2 svgalib - Generate SVGA video (Linux) [OBSOLETE] ----
This driver works in Linux and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the hardware registers of the recognized SVGA boards using
the SVGALIB library.

All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.
This driver is generally able to synchronize with the vertical sync
of the video mode.

To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a `svgalib' driver listed in the `cardlinx.txt' file.
To use this driver you need to install the SVGALIB library
version 1.9.x.

To use this driver you need to correctly configure the
SVGALIB HorizSync and VertRefresh options in the
file /etc/vga/libvga.config file.
You must use a range equal or a bit larger than the range
specified with the AdvanceMAME `device_video_clock' option.

This driver is not available in X (when the environment DISPLAY
variable is defined).

In the `contrib/svgalib' directory there are various
SVGALIB patches to fix some problems with recent video
boards, and to work with systems with kernel 2.6 and udev.

---- 1.2.3 svgaline - Generate SVGA video (DOS) [OBSOLETE] ----
This driver works in DOS and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the hardware registers of the recognized SVGA boards.

All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.

To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a `svgaline' driver listed in the `carddos.txt' file.

This driver is completely independent of the VGA/VBE BIOS
of your board.

---- 1.2.4 vbeline - Generate VBE video (DOS) [OBSOLETE] ----
This driver works in DOS and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the standard VBE (VESA) BIOS mode changing the hardware
registers of the SVGA.

All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.

To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a `vbeline' driver listed in the `carddos.txt' file.

These drivers work setting a video mode using the
default VBE2 services and tweak some hardware SVGA
registers to modify the obtained video mode.
The driver `vbe3' is an exception. It requires the
presence of a VBE3 BIOS to change the frequency of the
desired video mode. Unfortunately the standard
VBE3 services don't support a resolution size change.

The resolution is changed modifying only the standard
VGA registers. This hack may or not may works.
Also the interlaced modes are only rarely supported
by the various VBE3 BIOS because they are very rarely
used in the standard PC monitors.

If your video board isn't supported by any drivers and
you don't have a VBE3 BIOS you can try installing a
software VESA BIOS like the SciTech Display Doctor.

---- 1.2.5 vgaline - Generate VGA video (DOS) [OBSOLETE] ----
This driver works in DOS and is able to use video modes obtained
tweaking the hardware registers of the standard VGA.

Only the standard VGA pixel clocks 6.29, 7.08, 12.59,
14.16 MHz are available. Only 8 bit color modes. Only
64 kBytes of video memory.

This driver supports also text modes with pixel clocks
12.59, 14.16, 25.17, 28.32 MHz.

This driver is completely independent of the VGA BIOS
of your board.

---- 1.2.6 svgawin - Generate SVGA video (Windows) [OBSOLETE] ----
This driver works in Windows NT/2000/XP and is able to use video
modes obtained tweaking the hardware registers of the recognized
SVGA boards.

All clocks, all RGB bit depths are available.

To use these modes your video board must be supported
by a `svgawin' driver listed in the `cardwin.txt' file.

To use this driver you need to install the included SVGAWIN
driver. Please read the `svgawin.txt' file carefully.

This driver is experimental. At present it's only tested on
Windows 2000 with a GeForce 2 board. It may not work will
all the other boards.

1.3 Available System Drivers
----------------------------

The following is the list of all the System video drivers supported.

---- 1.3.1 sdl - System SDL video (Linux, Windows and Mac OS X) ----
This driver works in Linux, Windows and Mac OS X and is able to
use video modes reported by the SDL graphics library.

It supports all RGB bit depths available and the YUV mode.

The output in the YUV mode is generally accelerated, and can
be used to scale the video output to an arbitrary size.
You can enable this feature with the `-device_video_output overlay'
option.

You can change some options of this driver using the SDL specific
environment variables described in the contrib/sdl/env.txt file.

---- 1.3.2 slang - System sLang text video (Linux) ----
This driver works in Linux and is able to use current terminal text
mode from the Linux sLang library.

---- 1.3.3 curses - System curses text video (Linux) ----
This driver works in Linux and is able to use current terminal text
mode from the Linux ncurses library.

---- 1.3.4 vbe - System VBE video (DOS) [OBSOLETE] ----
This driver works in DOS and is able to use video modes reported
by the VBE BIOS.

must at least select a graphics and a text video driver. The
available text video drivers are `vgaline' for DOS, `slang',
`curses' for Linux and `sdl' for Windows.

You can force the detection of a specific model of video board
adding the name of the model driver after the driver name using
the `/' separator. For example to force the `vbe3' model
detection of the `vbeline' driver you must specify
`vbeline/vbe3'.

To get the list of all the available models try using the
`help' model name. A short help will be printed.

Please note that forcing a specific video driver is discouraged.
Generally you don't need it.

For a more complete description of the drivers check the
previous `VIDEO DRIVER' section.

Example to enable the `vbeline' and the `vgaline' drivers
with auto-detection for DOS:
    device_video vbeline vgaline

Example to force the `vbeline/vbe3' driver and the `vgaline'
driver for DOS:
    device_video vbeline/vbe3 vgaline

Example to enable the `fb' and `slang' driver for Linux:
    device_video fb slang

---- 4.1.2 device_video_output ----

        is enabled in window modes, and disabled
        in fullscreen modes.
    off - Always off.
    on - Always on, only if the video mode support it.

4.2 Generate Configuration Options
----------------------------------

The following are the common video configuration options
available for all `generate' video drivers, i.e. all the
video drivers with the exception of `sdl' and `vbe'.
The `sdl' and `vbe' video drivers simply ignore these
options.

---- 4.2.1 device_video_clock ----
Specify the monitor frequency range in term of horizontal and
vertical clocks. This option is MANDATORY.
Generally these values are specified in the technical page of
your monitor manual.

device_video_clock PIXEL_CLOCK / HORZ_CLOCK / VERT_CLOCK [; ...]

Options:
    PIXEL_CLOCK - Pixel clock range in MHz.
        The lower value is the lower clock generable
        by your video board. The higher value is the
        video bandwidth of your monitor. If you
        don't know these values you can start
        with `5 - 100' which essentially enable any
        video mode.
    HORZ_CLOCK - Horizontal clock range in kHz.
    VERT_CLOCK- Vertical clock range in Hz.

For any range you can specify a single value like `60' or a
range of values like `50 - 60'. For multistandard TVs and monitors
you can use more clock specifications separating them with `;'.

For example:
    device_video_clock 5 - 50 / 15.62 / 50 ; 5 - 50 / 15.73 / 60

Check the `install.txt' file for examples and other information.

---- 4.2.2 device_video_modeline ----
Define a video modeline. The modeline format is compatible with
the format used by the Linux SVGALIB library and by the
XFree Window system.

device_video_modeline Name CLOCK HDE HRS HRE HT VDE VRS VRE VT
	[-hsync] [-vsync] [+hsync] [+vsync] [doublescan] [interlace]

Options:
    Name - Name of the video mode. You can use the quotes
        '"` for the names with spaces.
    CLOCK - Pixel clock in MHz
    HDE HRS HRE HT - Horizontal `Display End',
        `Retrace Start', `Retrace End', `Total'
    VDE VRS VRE VT - Vertical `Display End',
        `Retrace Start', `Retrace End', `Total'
    -hsync -vsync +hsync +vsync - Polarization mode.
    doublescan - Doublescan mode.
    interlace - Interlaced mode.

Examples:
    device_video_modeline tweak320x240 12.59 320 336 356 400 240 \
    	249 254 262 doublescan -hsync -vsync

---- 4.2.3 device_video_format ----
Select the format of the video modes to create.
You can insert more than one of these option.

device_video_format HCLOCK HDE HRS HRE HT VDE VRS VRE VT

Options:
    HCLOCK - Horizontal clock in Hz
    HDE HRS HRE HT VDE VRS VRE VT - Like the modeline option

When a new modeline is created, AdvanceMAME uses a linear
interpolation of the two formats with the nearest horizontal
clock.

The default value of this option is for an Arcade 15 kHz monitor:

    15720 0.737 0.075 0.074 0.113 0.916 0.012 0.012 0.060

and for an Arcade 25 kHz monitor:

    25000 0.800 0.020 0.100 0.080 0.922 0.006 0.012 0.060

and for a VGA 31.5 kHz monitor:

    31500 0.800 0.020 0.120 0.060 0.914 0.019 0.004 0.063

Which one of these defaults is used depends on the setting of the
`device_video_clock' option.

---- 4.2.4 device_video_singlescan/doublescan/interlace ----
Limit the use of certain features.

device_video_singlescan yes | no
device_video_doublescan yes | no

        low-end driver allows it (default).
    no - Disable completely the bit depth.

---- 4.2.6 device_video_fastchange ----
Enable or disable the fast video mode change. If enabled the
current video mode is not reset before setting another video
mode. The reset isn't generally required, but some
limited DOS video BIOS need it. So, the fast change is disabled
for default.

device_video_fastchange yes | no

Options:
    yes - Enable the fast video mode change.
    no - Disable the fast video mode change (default).

4.3 vbeline Configuration Options

    DEVICE - Output device (default 'default').

Other possible choices generally are 'hw:0,0' for using the
frequency and format chosen directly by the hardware, or 'dmix'
for allow concurrent access to other applications at the
audio card.

Example:
    device_alsa_device dmix

If you want to configure the ALSA library to remap the `default' device
to the `dmix' device for all the applications, you can create
the `.asoundrc' file in your home directory with the following content:

    pcm.!default {
    	type plug
    	slave.pcm "dmixer"
    }
    
    pcm.dmixer  {
    	type dmix
    	ipc_key 1024
    	slave {
    		pcm "hw:0,0"
    		period_time 0
    		period_size 1024
    		buffer_size 16384
    		rate 44100
    	}
    	bindings {
    		0 0
    		1 1
    	}
    }
    
    ctl.dmixer {
    	type hw
    	card 0
