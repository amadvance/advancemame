<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 1.2 2012/12
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Fixed compilation with modern compilers.
</li>
<li>
Fixed the "alsa" audio driver in Linux. In modern distributions it was generating no sound.
</li>
<li>
Fixed a crash at exit when SMP is enabled.
</li>
<li>
Added a new option display_magnifysize to define the area to target with display_magnify auto.
</li>
<li>
Renamed the 'scale' video effect to 'scalex'.
</li>
<li>
Added the new 'xbr' video scaling effect. Better than 'hq'.
</li>
<li>
Added the new 'scalek' video effect. Better than 'scalex' and faster than 'xbr'.
</li>
<li>
If display_resizeeffect is auto, the default effect is now 'xbr', but it's decreased at runtime
to 'scalek', or 'scalex' if speed is required.
</li>
<li>
Removed blitting cache optimization. With modern caches it's not needed anymore.
</li>
<li>
Changed default doc/man dirs to prefix/doc and prefix/man.
</li>
<li>
Now in git repository.
</li>
<li>
Removed DLL files from the Windows distribution. New new compiler uses static libraries.
</li>
<li>
Compiled with SDL-1.2.14, zlib-1.2.5, expat-2.0.1, freetype-2.4.4, pthreads-w32-2-8-0.
</li>
</ul>

processing one segment up to the final stage before processing the next one.
</li>
<li>
The default output mode in Windows and X is now 'overlay'.
</li>
<li>
The default resize effect is now 'fractional' instead of 'integer'.
</li>

The 'overlaysize' option now has the default 'auto' which uses the current video mode.
</li>
<li>
New Windows icon at high resolution.
</li>
<li>
Ignored WINKEYS in Windows if input_hotkey is set.
</li>
<li>
The SDL library now force the video driver 'directx' as default.

<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.61.0 2002/07

<ul>
<li>
Removed the input_analog[] and input_track[] options. They

</li>
<li>
Upgraded at the SVGALIB 1.9.15 library.
</li>
<li>
Added the `vertical' and `horizontal' sections on the
config file. With these sections you can have
different configuration for vertical and horizontal
games. If you have a rotating monitor, you can now
always configure the correct orientation.
</li>
<li>
The `display_rotate auto' option now selects always the
`blit' rotation. The reason of this change is that
the `core' rotation will be completely removed on the
next MAME version (0.62).
On monoprocessor machines this may result in a
sensible slowdown on some games. Instead, on SMP
(multiprocessor) machines all these games are now
faster because the rotation is done in the parallel
blit thread.

In the Linux version if the HOME environment variable
is not set all the files are read and written on the
PREFIX/share/advance directory.

and higher limit of the pixel clock used.
YOU MUST ENTER THIS VALUE IN YOUR mame.cfg.
The lower value is the lower clock generable

<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.53.0 2001/08
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Major release with BIG changes. This should be considered
an alpha version.
</li>
<li>
Kept the support for 8 bit modes. You can still use 8 bit
modes for games with less than 256 colors without
problems. You can also use 8 bit modes for all the other
games but you lose in color precision.
</li>
<li>
The modeline format is changed. The new format is independent
of the video driver and of video board. The modelines
can now be exchanged between users.
</li>
<li>
Added a new set of video drivers called `svgaline' from
the Linux SVGALIB library. These drivers overperform
the old `vbeline' drivers. The old drivers are still
supported anyway.
These drivers are completely independent of the underline
VBE BIOS. You don't need the SDD utility anymore.
</li>
<li>
Added support for 32 bit depth.
</li>
<li>
The sources are now completely independent from the MAMEDOS
sources. They stay in a new directory called `advance'.
Check the updated `build.txt' to compile.
</li>
<li>
The configuration file is now named like the executable.
For example "mamepp.exe" checks for "mamepp.cfg".
</li>
<li>
Added the `videodepth' option to control the bit depth of the
video mode used. The old `depth' option is still present
but control only the internal size of the working MAME
bitmap.
</li>
<li>
Added the command line option `-default' to create a default
`mame.cfg' file.
</li>
<li>
Removed the `videogenerate=adjustxy' option.
</li>
<li>
Removed all the -list* and -verify* options. These will may be
added in a future version with an external utility.
Only the -listinfo option is maintained.
</li>
<li>
Updated the `mv' and `cfg' utility at the new features.
</li>
<li>
Updated the `card.txt' file with a complete list of the video
board supported.
</li>
<li>
The safeexit option now uses the safequit.dat file to check if
the exit is safe or not. If the game is in demo mode and no
coin is inserted the "Continue/Exit" menu is not shown.
[Filipe de V. Estima (Bugfinder), Ian Patterson]
</li>
<li>
The `soundcard' option now uses text tag and not numbers.
The tags are :
auto - Automatic detection
sb - Sound Blaster
awe32 - Sound Blaster AWE 32 (probably the 'sb' driver is faster)
pas - Pro Audio Spectrum
gusmax - Gravis Ultrasound Max
gus - Gravis Ultrasound
wss - Windows Sound System
ess - Ensoniq Soundscape

Added the `[config] magnify' option to suggest the use of
a double resolution.
</li>

</ul>
<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.37b9.0 2000/11

multisync monitor which can accept a wide range of
vertical and horizontal frequencies.
Try with :
