		using the pokey sound chip. This avoid crashes and provide
		a better sound audio. One example is 'starwars'.
	) Don't update input configurations that are not changed at runtime.
	) Added a new 'config' option to allow to decide if the .rc configuration
		should be saved at exit or not. If saved, they are written
		in a resiliant way, able to resist to unexpected power-downs.

	) Added a new 'advblue' tool able to pair and connect automatically
		bluetooth joysticks and gamepads. This is Linux only.
	) Added a new 'ui_autocalib' option to automatically start a joystick
		calibration menu if no joystick is detected. This works better
		with the Linux event driver, with an immediate notification.
		With other drivers it checks only when the idle screensaver
		starts.
	) Other configuration options added: 'ui_topname', 'sort smart_time',
		'ui_text/bar_font', 'ui_outline', 'skip_horz' and 'skip_vert'
	) The configuration .rc file is wrote in a resiliant way, able to
		resist to unexpected power-downs. Take care that this is
		automatically disabled if the .rc is a symbolic link.
	) Always wait for vsync to avoid to use 100% CPU.
	) Added a new 'exit' event to separate the exit action from the
		generic esc one. Ensure to change also misc_exit to make this

		Raspberry VideoCore. There are some hidden timing
		dependencies that could cause VideoCore to misbehave.

		hdmi_timings. In hdmi_timings 1 means "inverted polarity",
		and then "-hsync/-vsync".
	) Fixes aspect ratio of Sega System 32 and most Neogeo games.
	) Improved the support for Sega Megadrive and
		Sega Master System recognizing more software formats.

AdvanceMAME/MESS/MENU Version 3.1 2017/01
	) Added support for SDL2. It's the new default in Linux and Windows.
		This results in better performance and better VSync support
		when running in a window manager environment like X Window
		or Windows. It also enables again the RGB effects.
		The exception is Raspberry where SDL1 still provides better
		performance in the X Window environment, and it's still the
		default option.
	) More reliable Raspberry video mode setting when using programmable
		modes. It now uses the Raspberry VideoCore libraries to
		control better the system.
	) More precise VSync synchronization, avoiding any missing frame.
	) In AdvanceMESS fixed the loading of disk image for the TI99-4A
		system.
	) In AdvanceMAME marked 'retofinv', 'svc', 'prmrsocr' and 'viostorm'

		Also added the game 'mp_shnb3'.
	) Fixed the UI flickering and a potential crash when SMP is active.
	) The Linux joystick event and raw interface now support up to 32
		button. Before it was only 12.
	) If SMP is active, don't automatically disable the resize
		effect if the game is too slow. This gives a more
		stable 'auto' effect.
	) Changed the 'sync_resample auto' to be 'emulation' instead
		of 'internal'. This give more stable sound when
		the game emulation is too slow.
	) The 'display_magnify auto' option now takes into account
		the monitor limits to avoid over scaling.
	) Restored the functionality of "-output fullscreen" option.
		It wasn't able anymore to find video modes.
	) Added support running from a SSH shell.
	) Removed the 'lq' effect. It was not really used.
		The 'scale2x' and 'scale2k' are faster and better.

		are already filtered out in the main list.

AdvanceMAME/MESS/MENU Version 3.0 2016/12
	) Now the AdvanceMAME package contains AdvanceMAME,
		AdvanceMESS and AdvanceMENU.
	) Customized for Raspberry Pi fixing various issues
		and improving performance, functionality and
		documentation
		Check the install.txt file for some more information
		about the use with a Raspberry Pi.
		The most important note is to run the Advance programs
		directly from the Linux Console and outside the
		X-Window graphics environment to be able to use the
		Raspberry hardware acceleration.
	) Improved synchronization to remove tearing with the Linux
		FrameBuffer.
	) Added a new category.ini installed automatically, that
		is used automatically by AdvanceMENU.
	) Added a new 'display_aspect' option that replaces
		the old 'display_aspectx' and 'display_aspecty'.
		This one allows aspect auto-detection with 'auto'.
		You have to manually adjust the advmame.rc file if you
		are using the old ones.
	) Changed the default of 'display_expand' to 1.25.
		This value allow to fill better a wide screen with
		old games. If you like more correct aspect, select 1.0.
	) Add a new AdvanceMENU 3x2 tile mode called "tile_tiny".
	) Better autoconfiguration for AdvanceMENU to be able to detect
		and configure AdvanceMAME and AdvanceMESS at the first run.
	) Change the default AdvanceMENU main and screen saver mode to animate
		all the clips.

		list files are not updated every time.

		'vfive' and 'vimana'.
	) Imported the CPS3 driver from ThunderMAME32Plus-v0.106X.
		This adds the games: 'sfiii', 'jojo' and 'warzard'.

	) Added knocker support to Q*bert. You should see a keyboard
		led on when the knocker is active [hainet].
	) Set the SCHED_FIFO scheduling policy with sched_setscheduler().
		This is reported to improve performance on Raspberry
		Pi 2 boards.
		Note that this ha effect only with root permission.
		You can see in the log for "os: scheduling".

		of the video driver and of video board. The modelines
		can now be exchanged between users.

		but control only the internal size of the working MAME
		bitmap.
	) Added the command line option `-default' to create a default
		`mame.cfg' file.
	) Removed the `videogenerate=adjustxy' option.

	) Updated the `card.txt' file with a complete list of the video
		board supported.
	) The safeexit option now uses the safequit.dat file to check if
		the exit is safe or not. If the game is in demo mode and no
		coin is inserted the "Continue/Exit" menu is not shown.
		[Filipe de V. Estima (Bugfinder), Ian Patterson]
	) The `soundcard' option now uses text tag and not numbers.
		The tags are :
		auto - Automatic detection
		sb - Sound Blaster
		awe32 - Sound Blaster AWE 32 (probably the 'sb' driver is faster)
		pas - Pro Audio Spectrum
		gusmax - Gravis Ultrasound Max
		gus - Gravis Ultrasound
