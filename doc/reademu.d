Name
	advmame - AdvanceMAME/MESS Emulator

	AdvanceMAME/MESS are unofficial MAME/MESS versions with an
	advanced video support for helping the use with TVs, Arcade
	monitors, PC monitors and LCD screens.

	They run in Linux, Mac OS X, DOS, Windows and in all the other
	platforms supported by the SDL library.

	The official site of AdvanceMAME/MESS is :

		+http://advancemame.sourceforge.net/

	The main difference compared with the official emulators is that
	the Advance versions are able to program directly the video board
	to always get a video mode with the correct size and frequency.

	Generally the Advance emulators are able to use a video mode which
	doesn't require any stretching or other unneeded effects to match the
	original arcade display.

	The direct video board programming is fully supported in Linux
	and DOS. It's partially supported in Windows. It isn't supported in
	Mac OS X and other platforms.
