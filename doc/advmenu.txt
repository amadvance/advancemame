4 EMULATORS
===========

The program supports many type of emulators. The emulators
AdvanceMAME, AdvanceMESS, MAME, SDLMAME, DMAME,
DMESS and DRAINE are directly supported and the only thing
you should do is to run the AdvanceMENU program in the same
directory of the emulator.

All the other emulators are supported with the emulator
type `generic'.

4.1 generic - Generic emulator
------------------------------

For the `generic' emulator no additional rom information is
needed. Only the name and the size of the rom files are used.

You should specify all emulator information and directories
with the `emulator' and `emulator_*' options in the
`advmenu.rc' file.

You need to use at least the `emulator' and `emulator_roms'
options to inform AdvanceMENU how to run the emulator and where
to find the roms.

For example:
    emulator "snes9x" generic "c:\game\snes9x\snes9x.exe" "%f"
    emulator_roms "snes9x" "c:\game\snes9x\roms"
    emulator_roms_filter "snes9x" "*.smc;*.sfc;*.fig;*.1"

    emulator "zsnes" generic "c:\game\zsnes\zsnes.exe" "-e -m roms\%f"
    emulator_roms "zsnes" "c:\game\zsnes\roms"
    emulator_roms_filter "zsnes" "*.smc;*.sfc;*.fig;*.1"

The various %s, %f, %p, ... macros are explained in the `emulator'
option description.

The roms are searched in the path specified with the
`emulator_roms' option in the `advmenu.rc' file. For every file
found (with any extension) a game is added in the menu.
You can filter the files with the `emulator_roms_filter' option.

All the snapshots are searched in the directories specified with
the `emulator_*' options using the same name of the rom file.

If you want, you can manually write a MAME like information file
and name it as `ENUNAME.lst'. This file has the same format
of the output of the `-listinfo' MAME command.
Actually only the information `game', `name', `description', `year',
`manufacturer', `cloneof' are used.
Please note that this file is used only to add information at the
existing games. The games present in this file are not automatically
added at the game list.

4.2 advmame - AdvanceMAME
-------------------------

For the `advmame' emulator type the roms informations are
gathered from the file `ENUNAME.xml'. If this file doesn't
exist, it's created automatically with emulator `-listxml'
command.

The directories specified in the `dir_rom' option in the
`advmame.rc' file are used to detect the list of the
available roms. In the DOS and Windows versions of the
program the `advmenu.rc' file is searched in the same directory
of the emulator. In the Unix version it's searched in the
`HOME/.advance' directory.

The directory specified in `dir_snap' is used to
detect the list of available snapshots.

4.3 advmess - AdvanceMESS
-------------------------

For the `advmess' emulator the rom information is gathered
from the file `EMUNAME.xml'. If this file doesn't exist,
it's created automatically with emulator `-listxml' command.

The directories specified in the `dir_rom' option in the
`advmess.rc' file are used to detect the list of the
available bioses.

All the directories listed in the option `dir_image' are
read and all the files found in the `machine' directories
are inserted as software if the extension is recognized as a
valid device extension for the current `machine' or if it's a
`zip' file.
For example if the `dir_image' options is `c:\software',
AdvanceMENU scans the directories `c:\software\ti99_4a',
`c:\software\sms', `c:\software\gameboy'...
Files in the main directory `c:\software' are NOT checked.

When you select to run a zip file, the zip file is opened and
all the files in the zip with a valid name and with a recognized
device extension are added at the AdvanceMESS command line.
A file is considered to have a valid name if has the same name
of the zip of if it has the name of the zip with an additional
char. For example in the file `alpiner.zip' the files
`alpiner.bin', `alpinerc.bin' and `alpinerg.bin' have a valid
name. This feature can be used to group all the required roms
to play a software in a single zip file.

The file extension is also used to correctly select the device
type when calling AdvanceMESS.

The directory specified in `dir_snap' is used to detect the
list of available snapshots.
At any exit of AdvanceMESS if a new snapshot is created, this
file is moved to the correct `snap\system' directory renaming
it as the software started.
For example, suppose that you run the `ti99_4a' system with the
software `alpiner'. If you press F12 during the emulation, the
file `snap\ti99_4a.png' is created. When you return to
AdvanceMENU the file is moved automatically to
`snap\ti99_4a\alpiner.png'.

4.4 mame - Windows MAME
-----------------------

For the `mame' emulator the roms information is gathered from
the file `EMUNAME.xml'. If this file doesn't exist, it's created
automatically with emulator `-listxml' command.

The directories specified in the `rompath' option in the
`mame.ini' file are used to detect the list of the available
roms.

The directory specified in `snapshot_directory' is
used to detect the list of available snapshots.

4.5 sdlmame - SDL MAME
----------------------

For the `sdlmame' emulator the roms informations are gathered
from the file `EMUNAME.xml'. If this file doesn't exist, it's
created automatically with emulator `-listxml' command.

The directories specified in the `rompath' option in the
`HOME/.mame/mame.ini' file in Linux and Mac OS X and in the 'mame.ini'
file in Windows are used to detect the list of the available roms.

Please note that in Linux and Mac OS X the 'mame.ini' file doesn't
support relative paths for roms and other files. Always use absolute
paths configuring SDL MAME. You can use the "$HOME" variable to
refers at the Linux/Mac OS X user home directory.

The directory specified in `snapshot_directory' is used to detect the
list of available snapshots files.

4.6 dmame - DOS MAME
--------------------

For the `dmame' emulator the roms informations are gathered
from the file `EMUNAME.xml'. If this file doesn't exist, it's
created automatically with emulator `-listxml' command.

The directories specified in the `rompath' option in the
`mame.cfg' file are used to detect the list of the available
roms.

The directory specified in `snap' is used to
detect the list of available snapshots.

4.7 dmess - DOS MESS
--------------------

For the `dmess' emulator the roms informations are gathered
from the file `EMUNAME.xml'. If this file doesn't exist, it's
created automatically with emulator `-listxml' command.

The directories specified in the `biospath' option in the
`mess.cfg' file are used to detect the list of the available
bioses.

All the directories listed in the option `softwarepath' are
read and all the `zip' files found in the `subsystem'
directories are inserted as software.
For example if the `softwarepath' options is `c:\software',
AdvanceMENU scans the directories `c:\software\ti99_4a',
`c:\software\sms', `c:\software\gameboy'...
Zips in the main directory `c:\software' are NOT checked.

When you select one of these entries the zip is opened and is
searched the first file with the same name of the zip but
different extension. This file is used as the argument of the
`-cart' option when running `mess'.
AdvanceMENU is NOT able to use other supports like `-flop'.

All the aliases present if the `mess.cfg' are inserted as
software entries. When you select one of these entries the
`mess' option `-alias' is used to start the game.

You can set an arbitrary description on an alias specification
adding it on the same line of the alias after the comment char
'#' using this format:

    ALIAS = ALIAS_DEF # Description | YEAR | MANUFACTURER

For example:
    [ti99_4a]
    ti-inva = -cart ti-invac.bin -cart ti-invag.bin \
    	# Invaders | 1982 | Texas Instrument

At any exit of the emulator if a new snapshot is created, this file
is moved to the correct `snap\system' directory renaming it as
the software started.
For example, suppose that you run the `ti99_4a' system with the
software `alpiner'. If you press F12 during the emulation, the
file `snap\ti99_4a.png' is created. When you return to
AdvanceMENU the file is moved automatically to
`snap\ti99_4a\alpiner.png'.

4.8 draine - DOS Raine
----------------------

For the `draine' emulator the roms informations are gathered
from the file `EMUNAME.lst'. If this file doesn't exist, it's
created automatically with emulator `-gameinfo' command.

All the directories specified in the `rom_dir_*' options are
used to detect the list of the available roms.

The directory specified in `screenshots' is used to detect the
list of available snapshots.


5 CONFIGURATION
===============

The file `advmenu.rc' is used to save the current state of the
front-end. It's read at startup and saved at exit. You can
prevent the automatic save at the exit with the `config' option.

In DOS and Windows the configuration options are read from the
file `advmenu.rc' in the current directory.

In Linux and Mac OS X the configuration options are read from the
files `advmame.rc' and `advmess.rc' in the $host, $data and
the $home directory.
The $host directory is `$SYSCONFDIR', where $SYSCONFDIR is the
`sysconfdir' directory configured with the `configure' script.
The default is `/usr/local/etc'.
The $data directory is `$DATADIR/advance', where $DATADIR is the
`datadir' directory configured with the `configure' script.
The default is `/usr/local/share'.
The $home directory is `$ADVANCE', where $ADVANCE is the value of the
ADVANCE environment variable when the program is run.
If the ADVANCE environment variable is missing the $home directory
is `$HOME/.advance' where $HOME is the value of the HOME environment
variable.
If both the ADVANCE and HOME environment variables are missing the
$data directory became also the $home directory.

The priority of the options is in the order: $host, $home and $data.

The $home directory is also used to write all the information
by the program. The files in the $host and $data directory are only read.

You can include an additional configuration files with the `include'
option. In DOS and Windows the files are searched in the current directory.
In Linux and Mac OS X the files are searched in the $home directory if
they are expressed as a relative path. You can force the search in the
current directory prefixing the file with `./'.
To include more than one file you must divide the names with `;' in
DOS and Windows, and with `:' in Linux and Mac OS X.

You can force the creation of a default configuration file with the
command line option `-default'.

In DOS and Windows the directory name separator is `\' and the
multi-directory separator is `;'. In Linux and Mac OS X the directory
name separator is `/' and the multi-directory separator is `:'.

5.1 Global Configuration Options
--------------------------------

This section describes the global options used to
customize the the program.

A subset of the configuration options are saved per
emulator basis to allow different configurations for
different emulators. Please note that these specific emulator
configurations are not activated if you select to show
more than one emulator at time.
In this case only the default configuration is used.
Specifically these special options are `mode', `sort',
`preview', `group_include' and `type_include'.

---- 5.1.1 config ----
Selects if and when the configuration modified by the user at
runtime should be saved.

config save_at_exit | restore_at_exit | restore_at_idle

Options:
    save_at_exit - Save any changes before exiting
        (default).
    restore_at_exit - Don't save the changes. At the next
        run, restore the previous configuration.
    restore_at_idle - Restore the previous configuration
        after the `idle' time.

You can manually save the configuration at runtime from the
main menu.

---- 5.1.2 emulator ----
Selects the emulators to list in the menu. You can specify more than
one emulator.

WARNING! Before playing with this option, you should do a
backup copy of your current `advmenu.rc' because when you remove
an emulator, the game information for that emulator (like
the time played) is lost.

emulator "EMULATOR" (generic | advmame | advmess | mame | dmame
	| dmess | draine) "[-]EXECUTABLE" "ARGUMENTS"

Options:
    EMULATOR - The name for the emulator. It must be
        different for every emulator defined.
    generic - It's a generic emulator.

    advmess - It's the AdvanceMESS emulator.
    mame - It's the Window MAME emulator.
    dmame - It's the DOS MAME emulator.
    dmess - It's the DOS MESS emulator.
    draine - It's the DOS Raine emulator.
    [-]EXECUTABLE - The executable path of the emulator.
        In DOS and Windows you can also use a batch (.bat)
        file, but this prevent the automatic generation of
        the listing file which must be generated manually.
        You can put a `-' in front of the file path
        to ignore any error returned by the executable.
    ARGUMENTS - The arguments to be passed to the emulator.
        The arguments are required only for the `generic'
        emulator. For the others, AdvanceMENU automatically
        adds the required arguments to run a
        game. However, you may wish to add extra
        arguments.

In the emulator arguments some macros are substituted
with some special values:
    %s - Expanded as the game name. For example "pacman".
    %p - Expanded as the complete path of the rom. For
        example "c:\emu\roms\pacman.zip".
    %f - Expanded as the rom name with the extension. For
        example "pacman.zip".
    %o[R0,R90,R180,R270] - Expanded as one of the R* string,
        depending on the current menu orientation.
        Note that you cannot use space in the R* string.
        For example "%o[,-ror,-flipx,-rol] %o[,,-flipy,]"
        correctly rotate the AdvanceMAME emulator.

For the `generic' emulator type you need use the % macros
to tell at the emulator which game run. For all the other emulator
types this information is automatically added by AdvanceMENU.

Examples for DOS and Windows:
    emulator "AdvanceMAME" advmame "advmame\advmame.exe" \
    	"%o[,-ror,-flipx,-rol] %o[,,-flipy,]"
    emulator "MAME" mame "mame\mame.exe" "-nohws"
