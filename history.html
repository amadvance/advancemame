</li>
</ul>
<h2> 
AdvanceMAME/MESS Version 3.9 2018/09

Fixed input games with a relative input when controlled with
an absolute controller. Like 'cabal' or 'offroad' when
controlled with a joystick.

size when the game has an artwork to display.

a better sound audio. One example is 'starwars'.
</li>
<li>
Don't update input configurations that are not changed at runtime.
</li>
<li>
Added a new 'config' option to allow to decide if the .rc configuration
should be saved at exit or not. If saved, they are written
in a resiliant way, able to resist to unexpected power-downs.
</li>
<li>
Fixed font size computation. Now the menu always has the same size.
</li>
<li>
In AdvanceMESS added a new 'misc_ui' option to configure the keyboard
emulation. Note that the default is now to have partial emulation

interface.

to simulate some keypress.
</li>

option allows it.
</li>
<li>

bluetooth joysticks and gamepads. This is Linux only.
</li>
<li>
Added a new 'ui_autocalib' option to automatically start a joystick
calibration menu if no joystick is detected. This works better
with the Linux event driver, with an immediate notification.
With other drivers it checks only when the idle screensaver
starts.
</li>
<li>
Other configuration options added: 'ui_topname', 'sort smart_time',
'ui_text/bar_font', 'ui_outline', 'skip_horz' and 'skip_vert'
</li>
<li>
The configuration .rc file is wrote in a resiliant way, able to
resist to unexpected power-downs. Take care that this is
automatically disabled if the .rc is a symbolic link.
</li>
<li>
Always wait for vsync to avoid to use 100% CPU.
</li>
<li>
Added a new 'exit' event to separate the exit action from the
generic esc one. Ensure to change also misc_exit to make this
command to work.
</li>
<li>

color.
</li>
</ul>

name is still supported.
</li>

<li>
Fixed Linux ALSA sound jitter increasing the number of periods.

Raspberry VideoCore. There are some hidden timing
dependencies that could cause VideoCore to misbehave.

</li>
<li>
Improved the support for Sega Megadrive and
Sega Master System recognizing more software formats.

'joystick[]' input definitions.
</li>
<li>
Disabled the SDL2 system keyboard hotkeys to avoid to lose focus.

Fixed the loading of software images from the UI file browser.
</li>
</ul>
<h2>

</h2>

Always prints the system name, even if it's not runnable, if it
has dependent software.

<li>
Added a filter for duplicated games. For example,
you can use it to show only the MAME games not present in
AdvanceMAME.
</li>
<li>
Added support for reading MNG files generated by MAME.
</li>
</ul>
<h2> 
AdvanceMAME/MESS/MENU Version 3.1 2017/01
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Added support for SDL2. It's the new default in Linux and Windows.
This results in better performance and better VSync support

or Windows. It also enables again the RGB effects.
The exception is Raspberry where SDL1 still provides better
performance in the X Window environment, and it's still the
default option.
</li>
<li>
More reliable Raspberry video mode setting when using programmable
modes. It now uses the Raspberry VideoCore libraries to
control better the system.

</li>
<li>
Customized for Raspberry Pi fixing various issues
and improving performance, functionality and
documentation
Check the install.txt file for some more information
about the use with a Raspberry Pi.
The most important note is to run the Advance programs
directly from the Linux Console and outside the
X-Window graphics environment to be able to use the
Raspberry hardware acceleration.

are using the old ones.
</li>
<li>
Changed the default of 'display_expand' to 1.25.
This value allow to fill better a wide screen with
old games. If you like more correct aspect, select 1.0.
</li>
<li>

<h2> 
AdvanceMAME Version 0.53.0 2001/08
</h2>
<ul>
<li>
Major release with BIG changes. This should be considered
an alpha version.
</li>
<li>
Kept the support for 8 bit modes. You can still use 8 bit
modes for games with less than 256 colors without
problems. You can also use 8 bit modes for all the other
games but you lose in color precision.
</li>
<li>
The modeline format is changed. The new format is independent
of the video driver and of video board. The modelines
can now be exchanged between users.
</li>
<li>
Added a new set of video drivers called `svgaline' from
the Linux SVGALIB library. These drivers overperform
the old `vbeline' drivers. The old drivers are still
supported anyway.
These drivers are completely independent of the underline
VBE BIOS. You don't need the SDD utility anymore.
</li>
<li>
Added support for 32 bit depth.
</li>
<li>
The sources are now completely independent from the MAMEDOS
sources. They stay in a new directory called `advance'.
Check the updated `build.txt' to compile.
</li>
<li>
The configuration file is now named like the executable.
For example "mamepp.exe" checks for "mamepp.cfg".
</li>

video mode used. The old `depth' option is still present
but control only the internal size of the working MAME
bitmap.
</li>
<li>
Added the command line option `-default' to create a default
`mame.cfg' file.
</li>
<li>
Removed the `videogenerate=adjustxy' option.

Removed all the -list* and -verify* options. These will may be
added in a future version with an external utility.
Only the -listinfo option is maintained.
</li>
<li>
Updated the `mv' and `cfg' utility at the new features.
</li>
<li>
Updated the `card.txt' file with a complete list of the video
board supported.
</li>
<li>
The safeexit option now uses the safequit.dat file to check if
the exit is safe or not. If the game is in demo mode and no
coin is inserted the "Continue/Exit" menu is not shown.
[Filipe de V. Estima (Bugfinder), Ian Patterson]
</li>
<li>
The `soundcard' option now uses text tag and not numbers.
The tags are :
auto - Automatic detection
sb - Sound Blaster
awe32 - Sound Blaster AWE 32 (probably the 'sb' driver is faster)
pas - Pro Audio Spectrum
gusmax - Gravis Ultrasound Max
gus - Gravis Ultrasound
wss - Windows Sound System
ess - Ensoniq Soundscape
</li>
